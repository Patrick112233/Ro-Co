# Ro-Co 😃🎓

The **Ro-Co** (Rosenheim Community) app is a community-driven web platform that connects students and enables interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. 🤝

We aim to offer students a safe space to ask questions about their studies and private projects, encouraging a maker mentality by leveraging the enormous shared knowledge. As an open-source project, we want to encourage students to contribute and help shape the platform to their needs, creating a central platform that connects students. 🌱✨
