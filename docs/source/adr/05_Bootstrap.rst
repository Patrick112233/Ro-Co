ADR#5: UI Library â€” Bootstrap
==========================================================

This ADR documents the decision process for choosing the UI component and styling library for the frontend.

Forces
------
The decision is influenced by:

* Development speed and ease of use
* Consistency and quality of UI components
* Customizability and theming
* Community support and documentation
* Integration with React and other frontend tools
* Responsiveness and accessibility
* User experience and design consistency
* Familiarity for developers and contributors

Decision
--------

We will use Bootstrap as the primary UI library for the frontend.

Rationale
---------

**Pro Bootstrap:**

* Mature, stable, and widely adopted UI framework
* Large collection of pre-built, responsive components
* Excellent documentation and community support
* Easy to integrate with React (via react-bootstrap or custom usage)
* Fast prototyping and consistent design out-of-the-box
* Good accessibility support

**Pro Other Libraries (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Tailwind):**

* Material UI: Modern look, deep integration with React, but heavier and steeper learning curve
* Tailwind: Utility-first, highly customizable, but requires more setup and design effort

**Con Other Libraries:**

* May have steeper learning curve or require more configuration
* Are less familiar to many developers

We chous Bootstrap for its Simplicity, as other UI frameworks may cause unnecessary complexity for a fairly simple UI.

Status
------

Accepted

Consequences
------------

* The frontend will use Bootstrap for UI components and styling.
* Developers benefit from fast prototyping and a consistent, responsive design system.
* Switching to another library in the future is possible, but would require refactoring UI components.
