ADR#4: Authentication â€” react-auth-kit vs Self-Implemented JWT
=============================================================

This ADR documents the decision process for choosing the authentication solution for the frontend.

Forces
------
The decision is influenced by:

* Security and reliability of authentication
* Development speed and ease of integration
* Community support and documentation
* Flexibility and extensibility
* Maintenance burden and risk of security flaws
* Compatibility with React and JWT-based backend

Decision
--------

We will use `react-auth-kit` as the authentication solution for the frontend.

Rationale
---------

**Pro react-auth-kit:**

* Provides a robust, well-tested, and actively maintained authentication solution for React
* Handles JWT storage, refresh, and context management out-of-the-box
* Reduces risk of introducing security flaws through custom code
* Saves development time and effort
* Good documentation and community support
* Easily integrates with React and REST APIs

**Pro Self-Implemented JWT:**

* Maximum flexibility and control
* Can be tailored to very specific requirements

**Con Self-Implemented JWT:**

* Higher risk of security bugs and mistakes
* More code to maintain and test
* Slower development and more boilerplate


Status
------

Accepted

Consequences
------------

* The frontend will use `react-auth-kit` for authentication and JWT management.
* Users benefit form a secure, tested, and easy-to-use authentication flow.
* Custom authentication logic is minimized, reducing maintenance and risk.
