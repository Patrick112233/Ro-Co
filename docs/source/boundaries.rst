===================================


Since Ro-Co is a community-driven project, we do our best to keep compliance with the following constraints:

General Constraints:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Open Source**: The project is free and open source, allowing anyone to contribute and use the code under the terms of the MIT License.
* **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: The project complies with GDPR, ensuring that user data is handled responsibly and transparently. This includes:
  
  * Collecting only necessary data.
  * Providing users with control over their data.
  * Ensuring data security and privacy via encryption and secure storage. (to be implemented)


* **Legal Compliance**: The project adheres to all relevant laws and regulations, including:

  * Informed consent for data collection and processing.
  * Provide functions for content moderation to prevent the spread of illegal or harmful content.
  * Correct labeling of third party intellectual property.
  * Legal disclosure of the project and its contributors. (to be implemented)
  * Cookie consnt (to be implemented)

* **Security**: The project is reqired to follows best practices for security, including:
  * Implementation of secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
  * Use of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  * Use of secure communication and proper data encryption. (currently suspended due lack of deployment)

* **Ethical Standards**: The project promotes ethical standards in software development, including:
  
  * Transparency in data handling and processing.
  * Fairness in user interactions and content moderation.
  * Inclusivity and accessibility for all users, regardless of their background or abilities. (to be optimized)

* **Volunteer and Community dependence**: As the project is community-driven, it relies on volunteers and community contributions. This includes:
  
  * Encouraging contributions from students and developers.
  * Providing ann automated check for code quality and compliance with project standards.
  * The project is none-profite and thus relayes on cost minimication and on donations and sponsorships to cover costs.

* **Independence**: The developed features should be as independen as possible of any university organization, allowing it to adapt and evolve based on community needs and feedback.


Technical Constraints:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The frontend should be developed using modern web technologies, ensuring compatibility with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and devices (smartphones, tablets, desktops).
* The used technologies should be mostly complient with the thogth lectures of the university, such as Java, Spring Boot, and React JS.
* The prject should be developer freandly esspecialy for jenior developers, with a focus on clean code, modular design, and comprehensive documentation.
* The project must be dockerized to ensure consistent development and deployment environments.
