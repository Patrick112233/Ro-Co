4. Solution Strategy
================

This section summarizes the fundamental decisions and solution strategies that shape the architecture of the Ro-Co system. These decisions address technology choices, system decomposition, approaches to achieving quality goals, and relevant organizational aspects. For detailed rationale and alternatives, see the individual ADRs and referenced sections.

Fundamental Decisions and Strategies
------------------------------------

   * - Quality Goal
     - Scenario
     - Solution Approach
     - Link to Details
   * - Maintainability
     - Codebase should be easy to extend and refactor
     - Use of modular architecture, clear separation of frontend (React) and backend (Spring Boot), and strict code quality checks
     - ADRs 01, 03, 06
   * - Security
     - Protect user data and prevent common attacks
     - JWT-based authentication, backend validation, XSS and injection prevention, minimal data exposure
     - ADRs 04, 08; Crosscutting Concepts
   * - Performance
     - Fast response times and interactive UI
     - REST API, efficient data access, frontend state management, fallback for external APIs
     - Base Architecture, Runtime View
   * - Scalability
     - Handle increasing users and data
     - Stateless backend, scalable database (MongoDB), containerized deployment
     - ADRs 02, 07; Deployment View
   * - Usability
     - Intuitive and accessible user experience
     - Modern UI libraries (Bootstrap, FontAwesome, Motion), responsive design, accessibility best practices
     - ADRs 05, 06; Crosscutting Concepts
   * - Reliability
     - System remains available and robust
     - Health checks, fallback for external services, comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
     - Runtime View, Quality Requirements
   * - Community-driven
     - Encourage open-source contributions
     - Public repository, clear documentation, modular code, open to student input
     - Project Overview, ADRs

Top-Level Decomposition
----------------------
- The system is split into three main components: frontend (React), backend (Spring Boot), and database (MongoDB).
- Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for backend structure.
- Uses RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.

Organizational Decisions
------------------------
- Open-source development model, encouraging student and community contributions.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for quality assurance and rapid feedback.
- Use of third-party libraries for authentication, UI, and testing to accelerate development.

Motivation
----------
These strategies and decisions are based on the project's problem statement, quality goals, and constraints. They provide a foundation for detailed design and implementation, ensuring the system meets its requirements for maintainability, security, performance, and usability. For further details, see the referenced ADRs and documentation sections.
