10. Quality Requirements
===================

This section defines the quality requirements for the Ro-Co platform, covering both code and general system quality. These requirements help ensure a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly application.

Code Quality
------------
- **No High-Rated SonarQube Warnings:**
  - The codebase must not contain any high-severity issues as reported by SonarQube static analysis.
- **Backend Test Coverage ≥ 80%:**
  - At least 80% of backend code must be covered by automated tests (unit, integration).
- **Frontend Test Coverage ≥ 80%:**
  - At least 80% of frontend code must be covered by automated tests.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - All REST API endpoints must be covered by integration tests, simulating common usage scenarios.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
  - E2E tests must ensure that all core user functions work correctly in Chromium and Firefox browsers (WebKit is not required).

General Quality
---------------
- **Interactive GUI:**
  - The user interface should be fully interactive without requiring manual browser reloads. Page reloads should complete in under 1 second (manually checked).
- **Resilience to External API Failures:**
  - The application must remain functional even if external APIs are unavailable, using fallback mechanisms where necessary (ensured by design and tests).
- **Security:**
  - Implement basic security mechanisms, including:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention
    - Database injection protection
    - Strong authentication and encryption for sensitive data
- **Accessibility:**
  - The application should be usable by people with disabilities, following accessibility best practices (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
- **Performance:**
  - The application should respond to user actions within 300ms for most interactions.
- **Scalability:**
  - The system should be able to handle increased load (users, data) without significant performance degradation.
- **Maintainability:**
  - The codebase should be well-documented, modular, and follow consistent coding standards to facilitate future development and onboarding.
- **Privacy:**
  - User data must be handled in compliance with privacy regulations. Only necessary data is collected and stored securely.
- **Transparency:**
  - The platform should provide clear information to users about data usage, privacy, and terms of service.

These quality requirements are continuously monitored and enforced through automated CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and regular manual checks.
